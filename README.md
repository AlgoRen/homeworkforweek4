This skate quiz starts with loading up a welcome screen where a user can choose to start quiz or view highscores. The goThroughQuiz function is called. On click of start quiz button an event listener in a the goThroughQuiz function is called and removes welcome page through the DOM. Quiz page is brought into view by selecting the attribute class and changing it from invisible to visible. The setTime function is called which starts a timer.
A function called newPage is called. The newPage function is responsible for setting up the quiz page by creating elements, setting attributes, creating the text content, displaying the first set of question and answers, and appending buttons to the page.

After the quiz page is set up an event listener is set to the container of the answer buttons and makes sure that the target element clicked is a button. Once that is found to be true it runs the nextPage function. The nextPage runs an if else condition to check to see if the selected button that corresponds with the correct answer found in the object of the corresponding array page of quizContent. I would finish this out in more detail but I have to submit my work now... to be continued...
